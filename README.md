# 🍱 - The Bento Programming Language

## ✨ Intro

A simple programming language written in Go, and I'm lazy to implement this project btw.

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. Clone the repo to local:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uynilo9/bento.git
```

2. Build the entire program:

```bash
make build
```

3. Run the Bento CLI to get started:

```bash
./bin/bento
```
